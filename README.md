#### Conventional commits

One of the things that might be different from other projects you've worked on is the commits convention we use. We use conventional commits to automate semantic versioning, release notes and other tasks. In a nutshell conventional commits is a way to define your commit messages with a more semantic meaning. You can find more info [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### Why Use Conventional Commits
- Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.
- Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits - landed).
- Communicating the nature of changes to teammates.
- Triggering build and publish processes.
- Making it easier for people to contribute, by allowing them to - explore a more structured commit history.
